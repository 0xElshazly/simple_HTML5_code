00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:13.590
Hi, I'm Colleen Van Lent and I'm happy
to welcome you to Introduction to HTML5.

2
00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:18.825
I am very excited to teach this course
because I love the idea that we

3
00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.915
finally will have some course that really
will explain the basics to as many people

4
00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:24.195
as possible.

5
00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.965
I love working with people and
I love working with technology and

6
00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:30.870
I think the best thing we can do is
have as many people involved as possible

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.900
to really make sure that we're
building things that everyone can use.

8
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.370
In this course,
we will be covering the basics.

9
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.100
I really can't emphasize enough
that we will be starting

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.340
at the very basic building blocks.

11
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.160
We'll start off talking about
what's called syntax and semantics.

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.195
What are the actual codes that people
write In order to make a webpage

13
00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:51.330
a webpage?

14
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.950
Are there any special meanings behind any
of these words that can convey special

15
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.820
information to those who may not be able
to access the web the same way I do?

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.080
Perhaps, someone who uses
special accessibility tools.

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.260
After we cover the syntax and semantics,

18
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.980
we're going to talk more about the
accessibility idea that I just eluded to.

19
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.430
This idea that if we're going to build
a webpage, what do we need to do

20
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.900
to make sure the most people as
possible can access the information?

21
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.950
We're also going to be talking about
getting started in technology and

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.850
writing code.

23
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.060
When I mean talking about getting
started I mean really talking about

24
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.760
getting started, right down to you and

25
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.490
I are gonna walk through together on
how we're going to create a file.

26
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.140
One of the things I think that really
trips people up when their starting to

27
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.440
learn computer science or any type of
technology based criteria, or curriculum,

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.610
is that professors or instructors say
let's get started, here's your homework.

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.970
Go ahead and do it and

30
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.280
everyone just kind of stops cuz
they're not sure where to get started.

31
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.370
I really want to be there for

32
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.760
you to show you how to get started and
get off on the right foot.

33
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.050
Let's talk about what we'll
cover in this course.

34
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.330
In Week One the focus is on questions.

35
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.880
It's not on coding, it's on questions.

36
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.840
I want you to understand what happens
when you type something into the URL.

37
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.210
If you type in www.introwebdesign.com,

38
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.340
how is this page magically
appearing in front of your browser?

39
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.480
I also want to talk to you about what
types of tools you are going to need

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.150
in order to code.

41
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.090
We're gonna talk about editors and
browsers and

42
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.210
other different software tools because
I want you to know right from the start

43
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.230
what you're going to need in
order to succeed in this class.

44
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.760
Finally, we're really
going to talk about HTML5.

45
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.620
What happened to HTML1?

46
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.550
What happened to HTML2?

47
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.240
What is this evolution of what's going on
with web design and the languages we use?

48
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.920
In Week One, again, almost no coding.

49
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.930
Really, just giving you an idea
of how the web works and

50
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.030
why it's important for
you to be able to interact with people and

51
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.660
with code that's being
used to create your sites.

52
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.370
Week Two, we're gonna talk a little bit
of theory, and then, unfortunately for

53
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.990
some people, a lot of code.

54
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.750
There's this idea of something
called the Document Object Model,

55
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.160
upon which all webpages are built.

56
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.220
If I can get you to understand just
a little bit about that, then later on,

57
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.110
if you decide to go off and use WordPress
or some other software to make your own

58
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.310
website, you're gonna be able to really
understand what's going on so much better.

59
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.850
We're gonna talk about things called
contextual tags and headings and

60
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.810
different things we can use to make
our site have different meanings and

61
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:22.470
different appearances.

62
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.960
We're going to talk about links,
images, lists, tables,

63
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.890
and also multimedia in case you would like
to add any video or audio to your site.

64
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.210
Week Three,
we're really going to put it all together.

65
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.390
At this point, you should know just enough
about HTML5 where you'll be dangerous.

66
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.610
Where you can create something that
works but doesn't work all the time.

67
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.190
In Week Three, we're gonna put it
together, and I'm gonna talk to you about

68
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.200
some of the things that are often
overlooked, such as validating your code.

69
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.690
How can we make sure that the code
that you wrote doesn't just look good,

70
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.260
it's syntactically correct?

71
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.640
It's going to work everywhere.

72
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.800
Again, when we validate your code,
we'll talk about the syntax but

73
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.980
we'll also talk about accessibility,
which is hey,

74
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.570
we validated your code to make
sure the rules are there.

75
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.470
Let's also validate and make sure
that the meaning is there, as well.

76
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.860
Finally, we'll talk about what's
called domain name registration and

77
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.550
web hosting because it's a lot more fun to
make websites if you can actually put it

78
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.360
out there on the internet and let your
friends and family see it, as well.

79
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.350
Finally, we'll work on a final project
where you'll put together a lot of

80
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.000
different things that
you've been learning.

81
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.610
You are going to create what we call,
syntactically valid multipage website.

82
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.990
Your site will have at
least two to three pages.

83
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.450
After you've done your coding, you'll run
it through to make sure it validates and

84
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.210
it's very accessible.

85
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.560
Your final project is actually going to
be something that's a little bit ugly,

86
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.930
I'm gonna admit to right now because we're
not going to be talking about styling,

87
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.530
we're not talking about different things.

88
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.940
I really just want you to
understand the HTML5 language and

89
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.660
that's all about content.

90
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.680
Let's talk logistics.

91
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.600
Let's talk about who this class is for.

92
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.590
Who am I aiming for for my star student?

93
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.509
I'm really looking forward to
teaching the complete beginner.

94
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.490
This class is not for those people who
were building a computer down in their

95
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.100
basement when they were 12 years old.

96
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.670
You are very welcome to
hang out with us but

97
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:22.090
we are really here to talk about how we,
through persistence, can create a website.

98
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.730
One of the things that I'm kind of
anti about is the word passion.

99
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.690
Now, I'm passionate about
teaching you this material but

100
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.900
I don't really feel like you need to
be passionate about technology or

101
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.300
passionate about computing to
really get a lot out of this class.

102
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.450
Instead, it's about persistence.

103
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.640
I'd like you to just hang in there and
learn enough that you can go off and

104
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.550
really help people build
better technology.

105
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.880
A little bit about of who I am,
I have a PhD in computer science which is

106
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.690
really the least important part of my
qualifications to teach this class.

107
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.600
Instead, I have two decades
of teaching experience and

108
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.970
I've taught a wide range
of different students.

109
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.150
My emphasis is always been on
education and I'm somewhat famous for

110
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.280
running around the classroom
helping people debug their code,

111
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.480
finding out what's going on here,
finding out what's going on there.

112
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.860
This whole idea of teaching this class is

113
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.940
novel to me because I am
sitting here not moving.

114
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.000
The important part is that I really do
care about people succeeding and so

115
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.680
I am hoping that I can help you
take your skills to the next level.

116
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.020
Here is that what everyone wants to know.

117
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.730
In this class, what kind of workload will
there be and how will you be evaluated?

118
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.380
There are going to be weekly videos.

119
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.600
Some of them are like this,
a lecture format.

120
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.950
You should really feel free
to watch them anywhere but

121
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.550
I also like to include some videos that
are going to be much more demo format.

122
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.600
By that, I mean you really want to watch
the video with a computer next to you, so

123
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.530
you can type along and
test it out and try it.

124
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.440
There will be weekly readings.

125
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.370
Most of them will be from
a free online textbook but

126
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.470
there may be some other online
articles I include as well, if I

127
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.950
happen to come across something that's
very timely for what we've been learning.

128
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.610
There will be weekly assessments,
typically, in the form of quizzes.

129
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:05.490
There will be that final project and
I put in here warning, it will be ugly.

130
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.270
I don't mean that
the process will be ugly.

131
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.810
I think you'll find it
very straightforward.

132
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.870
It's just again,
I can't emphasize enough that

133
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.410
this class is about the language HTML5,
it's not about creating beautiful sites.

134
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.690
It's about you really learning just
the building blocks and it's always so

135
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.240
much easier to build something ugly the
first time than build something beautiful.

136
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.110
How will you succeed in this class?

137
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.650
In a perfect world, you would be coding
with two or three other people and

138
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.280
you'd be talking and
you'll never be coding alone.

139
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.560
I'm hoping that you'll create a community,
probably through the message boards.

140
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.140
I need you to work smart.

141
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.300
One of the things that kills me is
when people say I spent three or

142
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.000
four hours working on this.

143
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.350
I never want to hear that from a student.

144
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.060
Instead, I feel that if you've ever
run into a problem when you're coding,

145
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.440
you should stop after 10, 15,
20 minutes max and go walk away.

146
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.690
Go get help from someone, take a break,
think about something else.

147
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.230
It's all about working smart,
not necessarily hard.

148
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.990
Next, you really need to learn
to look things up on your own.

149
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.020
There is no way I can teach you
everything you need to know about HTML5,

150
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.190
and you wouldn't want me to,
it would be very boring.

151
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.880
Instead, you need to feel
the confidence to go out and

152
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.810
use search engines to look up
the topics that you're interested in.

153
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.920
My job is to give you those key words and
key ideas so

154
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.730
you know what it is you
want to search for.

155
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.420
Finally, you really need to practice,
practice, practice.

156
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.520
You will not succeed in this course unless
you've written the code yourself and

157
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.120
really tried to muster your way
through some of the mistakes and

158
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.220
typos that you're going to have.

159
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:42.160
Let's just review.

160
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.590
Once again, this class is for beginners,
and I'm excited to have you join us.

161
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.080
When you're done with this class,
you will have the ability to write and

162
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.780
understand HTML5 code.

163
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.860
You're not leaving as a developer but

164
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.120
you are going to leave as
someone who understands code.

165
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.610
Finally, one of the key things that I'm
gonna stress throughout this whole course,

166
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.590
is that you will understand the importance
of accessibility in technology.

167
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.850
If when this course was done, I had even
one student who said, hey you know what,

168
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.950
I'm gonna go on and I might not be a coder
but I am gonna go work with somebody else

169
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.980
to help make their code more accessible,
I would be thrilled with that.

170
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.340
Welcome to the course and

171
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.129
I hope you have a lot of fun
as you learn more about HTML5.
